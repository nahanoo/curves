This project contains the growth data Alisson Gillon created for the 8 remaining MWF species on 31 different carbon sources. The carbon sources are mostly the same as for At, Ct, Ml and Oa, however Fumarate and Orotate was replaced by Citrate and Pyruvate. The media used to screen carbon sources for 108 and 1W contains nucleosides, amino acids and vitamins, or amino acids and vitamins, respectively.
